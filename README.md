# Type 'string' is not assignable to type 'number' in TypeScript
This repository demonstrates a common type error in TypeScript where a string is assigned to a number variable.  The error arises because TypeScript's type system enforces type safety, preventing incompatible type assignments.
The `bug.ts` file contains the erroneous code, while `bugSolution.ts` provides the corrected version.  The error is shown using a simple example of printing a message and a date to the console. The core issue is a mismatch between the expected return type and the actual return type of the function.
This example highlights the importance of careful type handling in TypeScript to avoid runtime errors and maintain code integrity.
